--- Definition ---

Drools is a Rule Engine that uses the rule-based approach to implement an Expert System and is more correctly classified as a Production Rule System.


--- Production Rule ---

when
    <conditions>
then
    <actions>;


The Knowlege Base is a repository of all the application's knowledge definitions. It may contain rules, processes, functions, and type models.

--- Rules File Structure ---

package package-name

imports

globals

functions

queries

rules


--- Package ---

The package name itself is the namespace, and is not related to files or folders in any way.

--- Globals ---

Globals are not designed to share data between rules and they should never be used for that purpose. 

--- Pattern ---

Patterns may refer to superclasses or even interfaces, thereby potentially matching facts from many different classes.
